## Engaging postmodern culture and the church.

David Brett serves with a deep sense of calling and purpose in Central Florida, where he wears many hats—as a pastor, chaplain, and sometimes even a carpenter. With an MDiv and a heart full of compassion, David believes that ministry is not just about preaching and teaching, but about walking alongside others through the joys and challenges of life. 

For David, life and ministry are about coming together—creating a community that is not just authentic, but deeply relational. It is a life of mutual care, a shared journey of faith, and an unwavering hope that, with God’s guidance, we can all become who we are meant to be. Through both the joy and the struggle, David’s heart is to help others find healing, wholeness, and connection, one step at a time.
