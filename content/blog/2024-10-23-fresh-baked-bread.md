I love the smell of fresh baked bread. Wanda went through a period where she had a "bread" machine. I loved it when she baked bread. The aroma just permeated the house. The aroma would bring back some very good memories.

**It is interesting to note that bread has a prominent place in the bible. In Genesis 18 Abraham shares bread with three angelic visitors.**

> *The Lord appeared to Abraham near the great trees of Mamre while he was sitting at the entrance to his tent in the heat of the day... When he saw them, he hurried from the entrance of his tent to meet them and bowed low to the ground. He said...Let me get you something to eat...So Abraham hurried into the tent to Sarah. "Quick," he said, "get three seahsof the finest flour and knead it and bake some bread."*

> In Genesis 14 he enjoys the bread served to him by Melchizedek. "*Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine. He was priest of God Most High, and he blessed Abram*..." -- Genesis 14:17-18.

In the ancient world bread was a staple at almost every meal. It was nutritional. It was a basic. But bread was more than just food. In the Bible to break bread with someone was to draw them into fellowship with you. To serve bread was a sign of welcome and hospitality.  

> If you were to break off a piece of bread and offer to someone, it was an invite and an acknowledgement that you were bound to each other.

During the reign of King David, he had a wise and honored friend. His name was Ahithophel. The king would seek his counsel before making major decisions and before heading into battle. They were close. They had many meals together. They broke bread together many times. David respected and valued Ahithophel in his life.

Then David's son Absalom decided to lead a coup and replace his father as king. In a strange turn of events Ahithophel sided with Absalom. David was heartbroken. He was torn up inside because of the depth of the betrayal.

<blockquote>
Listen to his words in Psalm 41:9,

*Even my close friend,
    someone I trusted,
one who shared my bread,
    has turnedagainst me*.

**He continues this lament in Psalm 55:12-14,**

*If an enemy were insulting me,
    I could endure it;
if a foe were rising against me,
    I could hide.
But it is you, a man like myself,
    my companion, my close friend,
with whom I once enjoyed sweet fellowship
    at the house of God,
as we walked about
    among the worshipers*.

In the life and ministry of Jesus he shared many meals and broke bread with many different people. He broke bread ...with his disciples. With people on the outside of Judaism -- tax-collectors, sinners. He even shared meals with his opponents, Pharisees and other religious leaders. Jesus modeled the power of sharing meals with those who didn't share his perspective. The bread on the table represented the possibility of relationship. It represented the potential of peace and harmony. It would be offered as the potential to understanding and respecting each other. Maybe by the time the meal was over they would leave bound to one another and with a new perspective about each other. Maybe this is the reason that Jesus described himself as the bread of Life. He offered to people the possibly of friendship and intimacy with God.

In John 13 Jesus is having his last earthly meal with his disciples. There is a lot that happens during this meal. It starts off with Jesus washing the feet of the disciples -- even the feet of his betrayer, Judas. As Jesus completes the task of washing the feet of all his disciples, he explains to them that one of them is about to betray him.

**Notice the quote of John 13:18**, "*I know those I have chosen. But this is to fulfill this passage of Scripture: "He who shared my bread has turnedagainst me*." Jesus is quoting King David in Psalm 41:9. The disciples are confused. They have no idea what is going on. They ask Jesus for clarification. They are bewildered.

Jesus responds in John 13:26-27 "*It is the one to whom I will give this piece of bread when I have dipped it in the dish." Then, dipping the piece of bread, he gave it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot. As soon as Judas took the bread, Satan entered into him*.

> **The room is silent. Jesus breaks off a piece of bread. He extends it to Judas. He takes the bread. The Scripture seems to indicate that he doesn't eat it. He simply gets up and leaves.**

Let's take a moment and think about this action considering the symbolism of bread as we have earlier noted. Is this an opportunity of Jesus offering to Judas one last chance at mercy and grace? Is Jesus looking at Judas? Eye to eye. And in that eye-to-eye contact saying don't do this. Is this an invite to act differently? The tradition in ancient Judaism was if he accepted the bread from Jesus and ate it, then it would be as though he was declaring he was bound to his rabbi.

> **But notice verse 30, "*As soon as Judas had taken the bread, he went out. And it was night*." Judas took the bread. I don't believe he ate it. He left the table. His actions indicate that he was no longer bound to Jesus. His ways. His values. His kingdom. Judas chooses his course of action. His fate was sealed. Darkness sets in.**

In today's world it is not uncommon to share a meal with others. Most of the time it is not difficult to extend grace and kindness during the meal. And notice this we open the meal with ... saying grace. Usually, we look can find common ground with just about anyone. However, what that someone who has wronged us. Someone who has bruised our ego? Someone who has gone behind your back and betrayed us? Jesus knew Judas would betray him and yet he offers him one last opportunity to be bound to him. A chance to change his mind and change his heart. Judas doesn't. In that moment his fate was sealed. I am taken back by the mercy that Jesus presented to Judas. It is striking. Judas didn't have it in his heart to receive the mercy and grace offered to him. His mind was made up. It was tragic.

This story teaches me that I need to realize that I am responsible for my heart, my attitude, and my actions. I am responsible for my health and my healing. I get to invite God's love, mercy and grace into any and all situations of my life. In every relationship I get to choose. Will I offer a someone, an enemy even, a place at my table? Will I tear off some bread and offer it to others in my life? Will I choose to accept bread when it is offered to me? The choice is mine.

> *On the night of his betrayal Jesus took bread offered it to his disciples and said take this all of you and eat. This is my body offered to you. Then he took the cup. Again, he gave thanks. Gave it to his disciples and said, Take and drink. For this is the blood of the new and everlasting covenant. As often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim my death until I come again.*

Lord Jesus thank you that you offer me a seat at your table. You offer to me the bread of the new and everlasting covenant. You offer to me forgiveness. Wholeness. Peace. And an abundant grace. You offer to me the opportunity to offer bread to others and allow your grace to abound in me and through me. In Jesus name amen.
