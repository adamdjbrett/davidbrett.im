Today I write a devotion of a different sort. Usually, I start my time here with a Scripture. Then an explanation of context. Then an application of some kind. Today I begin with some thoughts that I have about life. My life.

I think my life could be describes as a series of different hats that I wear. I have a variety of hats. Baseball hats. And an Irish Boston Scally cap. That is my favorite. But more than that I wear the hat of pastor. Teacher. Counselor. I also wear the hat of husband. Father. Friend. Those three last three hats are a treasure to me. All three of those hats are very important to me. All three of those hats have been transformational in my life. They have taught more about the practical dimensions of God's love than my theological academic training provided. Those hats allowed me to become more of a person that I wanted to be and needed to become.

It is interesting to note that the hat of husband helped me deal with my selfishness. Oh, it is still there, but it not what it used to be. This hat really did teach me that love is kind. Patient. Forgiving. Keeps no record of wrongs. And it is willing to compromise and wait. And love doesn't fail. With the hat of husband came the hat of dad. There are only three people in the world that get to really see me wear that hat. It is one of my greatest treasures. I have learned to play with my kids. Laugh with them. And cry with them. I have helped them move. They have helped me, and their mom move. We have walked through the valley of the shadows together. We have seen incredible sunrises and sunsets together. They are my greatest legacy. I can feel their pain. Their heartache. Their joys are my joys. Their successes are my successes. I am so proud of the people these three are and are becoming.

The third hat is one of the more interesting hats I wear. I don't seem to wear it enough. Between work. Things at home. And life itself. I wish that I could wear this hat more. Recently I read an article by Scott Sauls. He mentions the miracles of Jesus. Jesus healed the lepers. Gave sight to the blind. Opened deaf ears. But one of his greatest miracles was his deep profound friendship with twelve 20--30-year-old males. When I read that I had to laugh. The laughter quickly turned into a sobering reality. I realized that I need to work on that one. With God's help I will.

The other hats that I get to wear are pastor, teacher, pastoral counselor and those other vocationally related hats. I have come to the place in my vocation that I realize that I "get" to do this job. I love what I do. Now in the interest of complete disclosure I get frustrated, even aggravated at times with people and circumstances. And at times I fantasize about leaving it with them and simply working at Home Depot. To me the joy of wearing my pastor hat is when I see the internal spiritual light go on. Oh...that is what that means. Oh...that is why I should forgive. Walk in love. Be kind. Generous. The results far outweigh the frustrations.

The final hat I should mention is the most important one -- the hat of following Jesus. This hat is the most significant of all. It is not just a hat is the reflection of my heart and my soul. To be more like Him. To more like him in my relationships. My home. The church I serve. This is the hat that reflects true heart transformation. This is my favorite hat to wear. This is the hat that I should always be wearing. Never take it off.

In Jesus name amen.
