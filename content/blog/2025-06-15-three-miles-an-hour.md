Paul is writing a word of correction to the church at Corinth. Paul launched the church years earlier. He led them for several years, and then he moved on to plant some other churches. Now the church is in turmoil. Paul’s first letter to the Corinthians is an attempt to bring correction and order back to the church. 
     It is interesting to observe that as he brings correction he says, Follow my example, as I follow the example of Christ. Sounds simple enough. But it is far more complex that it seems. Paul lived in the first century. I live in the twenty-first century. 2000 years have elapsed since Paul or even Jesus walked the earth. 
     Someone recently pointed out to me that Jesus and Paul lived life at three miles an hour. That is the basic speed that humans walk. Now granted some folks in th    e first century had horses and chariots and traveled faster than three miles an hour. They are more of the exemption than the rule. 
 It is interesting to note that this morning my morning ritual is to get up, get ready and then head out to Starbucks for my morning coffee. On my way to get my coffee I try to take the fastest route possible. I get aggravated when I catch a red light. I need my coffee! I sort of live life at 60 miles an hour. I drive 99% of the places I go. The only time I really walk is when I walk our dog. Millie. Since we have gotten our dog I have become the official dog walker. I should note that Millie walks at her own pace. She does a lot of sniffing along the way. She has slowed my life down. In our walks I have noticed some new things. Houses for sale. Home owners who do their own lawn work. What cars people drive. Other people who walk their dogs. I have even met some of our neighbors as well.
     I have learned that there is something to be said for life at three miles an hour. Now I should note that I am not about to trade in my truck. But I think that I do need to experience life at three miles an hour more. At three miles an hour you can hear birds chirping. Neighbors talking. Dogs barking. At three miles an hour you notice a lot more. I kind of like noticing things around me more. I especially like walking Millie at night. The night sky is rich with the splendor of stars, planets, and the Milky Way.

> It reminds me of Psalm 19:
>  
> The heavens declare the glory of God;
>     the skies proclaim the work of his hands.
> 2 Day after day they pour forth speech;
>     night after night they reveal knowledge.
> 3 They have no speech, they use no words;
>     no sound is heard from them.
> 4 Yet their voice goes out into all the earth,
>     their words to the ends of the world.
 
All of that is easy to miss when you are traveling at 60 miles an hour. 
 
In Jesus name. Amen.
