> The Lord was with Joseph. ~Genesis 39:2

* * *

I thoroughly appreciate the story of Joseph in the book of Genesis. He was the 11th son of Jacob and the most favored of them all. That is never a good thing. Favoritism in families never goes well. It doesn’t go well for Joseph. Jacob gives Joseph things that he doesn’t give to the other sons. In particular he gives Joseph an honored coat – a coat of many colors. Probably made of silk or wool. Reaching to the floor. Decorated. Embroidered. It was a magnificent robe. It was a royal robe. It was also a robe that caused Joseph a lot of heartache. It became the object of derision with his brothers. Joseph eventually gets thrown into slavery. Separated from the father that loved him so deeply and his brothers who hated him so passionately.

The first person he serves is Potiphar. Joseph excels in serving his master. And there we read the statement; The Lord was with Joseph. It is interesting to note that four times that phrase reoccurs in his story. It simply shows how God was with him through some very difficult times. Joseph lives out and exemplifies the teaching of Paul in Romans 8:28, “And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who[a] have been called according to his purpose…”

I find great comfort in the story of Joseph. His story in some ways is everyone’s story -- everyone who follows Jesus. Obviously not in the detail of his story but in the underlying principles that guided his life. It is the story within the story. The Meta story. The meta narrative. The one that oversees and governs all our lives. The one that can give us hope and future. The one that keeps our joy and peace intact and abiding deep within. It is the story that guides us through the difficult and challenging times. It is the story that keeps us grounded when things turn around and God’s hand of blessing becomes obvious and substantial. It is the story that I pray governs the lives of my children, my family and the church I serve. That’s my story and I am sticking to it. In Jesus name. Amen.
