> *Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of compassion and the God of all comfort, who comforts us in all our troubles, so that we can comfort those in any trouble with the comfort we ourselves receive from God. For just as we share abundantly in the sufferings of Christ, so also our comfort abounds through Christ*. ~ 2 Corinthians 1:3-5

* * * 
Paul is writing his second letter to the church at Corinth. His first letter was one of correction. It was a tough letter to write. It is not a fun thing to give correction to anyone. But you do it for the future. You do it in the hope that the person will receive it and change their behavior. It seems that the first letter to the Corinthians did exactly that. They received it and made corrections. Paul now writes and opens this letter with more encouragement.

It is interesting to note that this letter opens with a word about suffering and comfort. Comfort found in Christ alone. Suffering is part of life. None of us get to pass on suffering or heartache. It is not optional. We don't get to choose, "No suffering for me." All of us will suffer in some way. The question becomes: what do you do with it? How do you handle it? Jesus tells us in John 16:33, "*I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace. In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world."* Paul adds to this discussion Romans 8:28, "*And we know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are the called according to His purpose*..."

I have learned over the years that we get to choose the attitude we have in times of suffering. It is so very easy to become bitter. It is the day we live in. it is so very easy to deconstruct. Tear about. Find elements to criticize. To find ulterior motives and hidden agendas. And maybe even a conspiracy or two. To choose to be hurt. But it is a totally different matter to walk through the suffering. Acknowledge it for what it is and grow through it and become a better person. Yes. Grow through it. Notice that the English term "better" is only one vowel different from "bitter." Yes, the letter "I". It is all in how I choose to handle the suffering. I will either become bitter or become a better person because of it. My choice.

I would also note that I get to choose to become better because the person of Jesus lives within me. He will empower me to grow through and grow beyond the pain, the heartache and the sorrow. We can do it because that is what he did. He literally asked God to forgive the very men nailing him to the cross. "Father forgive them because they don't know what they are doing." Christ lives in me and I can do all things through Him because He empowers me. God Bless. Have a good day.

Footnote. So I write this devotion, then I look in my inbox of my email and someone sent me this quote...

> *"The most beautiful people we have known are those who have known defeat, known suffering, known struggle, known loss, and have found their way out of the depths. These persons have an appreciation, a sensitivity, and an understanding of life that fills them with compassion, gentleness, and a deep loving concern. Beautiful people do not just happen."* ~ Elisabeth Kubler Ross**
