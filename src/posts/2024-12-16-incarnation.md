> Every high priest is selected from among the people and is appointed to represent the people in matters related to God, to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins. He is able to deal gently with those who are ignorant and are going astray, since he himself is subject to weakness. This is why he has to offer sacrifices for his own sins, as well as for the sins of the people. ~ Hebrews 5:1-3
* * * 

The writer of Hebrews is explaining the duties and calling of the high priest to his readers. He is selected from among the people. He is to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins. He is able to deal gently with those who are ignorant and taking detours in life. He is like us.
 
The writer is describing Jesus. Jesus came from among us. He was one of us. He came into this world like everyone else. As a baby he was dependent on Mary and Joseph for all the things a baby needs. And yet he was God with us. God incarnate. That simple sentence stretches the limits of human vocabulary and my imagination to wrap my mind around it. I want to drill deep into the how of it all. But I don’t think I will ever be able to completely understand it until that day I stand before him and say thank you.
 
I will never understand the how of the incarnation, but it is the why that truly has the most impact on me and my life. The holy God of the universe becomes a baby born in Bethlehem. Held by Mary and Joseph. Here’s a question: I have visited many families with babies. It is not uncommon for them to ask: do you want to hold him? Did any of the shepherds or did any of the wise men ask to hold the baby born to Mary and Joseph and for all humanity? I don’t know the answer. Honestly I don’t think Mary let any one hold baby Jesus. Just a feeling.
 
I don’t know if anyone got to hold the baby Jesus, but I do know that he holds me. He holds me in my weaknesses. My frailities. Vulnerablities. He holds me because he who knew no sin became sin for me so that in him I might become righteous and whole and forgiven. Because of that I owe him my complete devotion and all my worship.
 
Lord Jesus in this Christmas season thank you for reminding me of the greatest gift given – you. In your most holy name amen.
