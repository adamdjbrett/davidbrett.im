> Here is a trustworthy saying: Whoever aspires to be an overseer desires a noble task. Now the overseer is to be above reproach, faithful to his wife, temperate, self-controlled, respectable, hospitable, able to teach, not given to drunkenness, not violent but gentle, not quarrelsome, not a lover of money. He must manage his own family well and see that his children obey him, and he must do so in a manner worthy of full respect. ~ 1 Timothy 3:1-4

* * * 
Paul is writing his son in the faith – Timothy. Timothy is a young pastor and Paul is mentoring him. In this passage Paul gets in a conversation on leadership. It is noteworthy to see that in this conversation it is not skill building or people management, it is character development that Paul discusses. He even takes it a step further and says look at how a future leader leads his family. The last phrase stands out to me, “he must do so in a manner worthy of full respect.”

Leadership is tough. It is not easy nor is it for the faint of heart. It seems that some people come by leadership naturally. The rest of us must learn it as we go. I have so much to learn about leadership. I would note that Paul’s conversation with Timothy indicates that leadership starts from within. It starts with the management and leading of self. Leadership then flows over into managing and leading your family.

I have found over the years that you can learn so much about a person by watching how they speak and lead their children and their family. How do they talk to them? How do they get up and help with chores around the house? Do they go the “extra mile” in being there for them? How do they interact with their neighbors? Jesus once said, “that out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.” Maybe one could say that out of the abundance of the heart a person leads.

Lord Jesus thank you for allowing me the privilege to lead and to work in a church that points people to you. Help me to lead with integrity and character – character that reflects you. In Jesus name amen.
